                        MWS Notebook was intially created as a personal reference book during my studies 
                        to become a Mobile Web Specialist. The site was meant to be a demonstrative of 
                        how much I was learning, a way of showcasing newly acquired concepts, technologies 
                        and practising in general. Of course with time, the volume and quality of the content 
                        became more meaningful, with core fundamental concepts and reusable. Since then, I 
                        have worked tirelessly to standardise the content and increase its spectrum, 
                        hopefully so that this can be a useful guide to beginners or anyone who need to have
                        a firm understanding i the Fundamentals of becoming a Mobile Web Specialist. The 
                        contents of this site has been collaborated to by a handful of educators with careers
                        similar to this who believe that fundamental skills can prepare you for any technology 
                        shift as you will have a core understanding of the building blocks of the technology.

                    consist of elements, content, links, references, and media. HTML5 is a recent version 
                    of HTML, with upgraded in terms of elements that improve the semantics of code, 
                    readabilty and better function.

                    The JavaScript Getting started Course was created with beginner introductory content. 
                    This course covers content from 'what is JavaScript', history of JavaScript and the 
                    semantics. Countless exercises to get started with the language of the web are included
                    to serve as a way to further explain content and build on the understanding and application

                2019 on record has been the best year yet in my life. A lot of changes, challenges, lessons, happy moments, pain, 
                chances and opportunities. As most, I have had the honour to part take in a life time opportuntiy sponsored by Google,
                Andela and Pluralsight. Through these past months my confidence in my capabilities has elevated. I am no expert but a 
                simple proeficient student. I can say I know a little bit of everything when it comes to fundamental concepts of the web.
                2019 I not yet over and so are my dreams, goals and plans for tomorrow, to give back and help grow the industry. Many 
                Thanks to my sponsors and my slack friends for all the support, never felt more empowered.
