                    This book is for beginners who are looking forward to pursue a career as a 
                    <em>Mobile Web Specialist</em>. The initial intent of the book was to use it
                    as a personal reference module. The need to share all that I had learned and 
                    all my notes forced me to have a somewhere centralised to access the content.
                    Since I was studying to become a Mobile Web Specialist, I resorted to the web. <br>
                    Besides having a centralised access point, I also wanted to be able to update
                    the content easily and be able to include a lot of media to support the content.

                </p>

                    MWS was coined by Google. This book was born out of my studies towards achieving
                    a MWS certification. The contents of this book however are summeries from courses
                    from Pluralsight. And the authors of these courses had seasons of coding experience
                    before hosting their content online.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    This book contains well summerised concepts, examples of which some are self 
                    explanatory, links to videos, and links to other external resources. I am excited
                    to begin this journey towards acquiring the necessary skills to equip you on 
                    becoming a competetive Mobile Web Specialist.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior coding experience is not required to engage with this content. However, 
                    your time, a computer and internet access will be all you need. For experienced 
                    developers, the content might seem a little light weight and not super challenging 
                    but if you need to polish up on the fundamentals of the web technologies, then 
                    this is a good place to begin.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will cover a lot of content, and selected and relative technologies. For more 
                    technologies please visit other content. An incremental design is used in this book.
                    Content will gradually increase in complexity and structure but all in a comfortable
                    manner. Some sections are independent of others meaning you can start where you want
                    and not be affected by knowing any of the previous content in the book.
                    Lets get started!
